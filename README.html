<h1>What everything does</h1>
<dl>
<dt>addresses/</dt>
<dd>Stores the claim timestamp of every user address to discourage obvious cheaters. (I recommend cleaning this folder out once per day to save space.)</dd>
<dt>referrers/</dt>
<dd>Saves the referrer of each address so that they still get paid if a user later visits without using the reflink.</dd>
<dt>users/</dt>
<dd>Stores the claim timestamp of every unique user on FaucetHUB to prevent cheating.</dd>
<dt>441.php</dt>
<dd>An error page explaining what is going on if the faucet is overloaded. (Too many claims in a short period of time, the faucet will stop paying out for a minute or so.)</dd>
<dd>If this happens often, you can <a href="https://faucethub.io/ticket/fh">open a support ticket</a> and ask mexicantarget to increase the limit slightly.</dd>
<dt>claim.php</dt>
<dd>The claim page, where the magic happens.</dd>
<dt>config.php</dt>
<dd><strong>All the settings are in this file.</strong></dd>
<dd>In the faucet_source.zip file, it is renamed to &ldquo;config.template.php&rdquo;. Just rename it after you edit it.</dd>
<dt>index.php</dt>
<dd>The first page people see, serves as the entry point to the faucet.</dd>
<dt>main.css</dt>
<dd>Customize the site style.</dd>
<dt>verify.php</dt>
<dd>Checks if the CAPTCHA was solved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>ads.i.php</dt>
<dd>Included at the bottom of the claim page, for ads to be shown a ton of times.</dd>
<dt>ads_q.i.php</dt>
<dd>For &lsquo;quality&rsquo; ads &mdash; ads that shouldn&#700;t be shown on the automatic pages.</dd>
<dt>iframetraffic.i.php</dt>
<dd>Put sponsored sites here.</dd>
<dt>navbar.i.php</dt>
<dd>Contents of the top navbar.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(all other files are unnecessary)</p>
<p>There, now that you know what everything does, modify the script, add your ads to the pages, and release another beautiful complexity-free (for the users, anyway) faucet into the wild!</p>
<p><strong>Make sure that the faucet is set up under the &ldquo;PTP&rdquo; category on FaucetHUB&#700;s faucet manager page, or users could get their accounts frozen for claiming too often!</strong></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.geekbasic.com/blkads">BLKAds</a> is a good ad to put on the claim page. Just add the following code: <code>&lt;iframe style="height:240px;width:100%" src="http://www.geekbasic.com/blkads/index.php?r=<var>YOUR_BLK_ADDRESS</var>"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code> and it will pay you through FaucetHUB!</li>
