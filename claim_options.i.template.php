<!-- Claim options. You can leave this file blank, or add form elements for customizing the claim page.
   - Here is what mine looks like, for reference (all the effects are in ads.i.php though)

<br/><input type="checkbox" name="miner"/> Allow the site to mine on one thread with 80% idle time (more profits mean more payouts eventually!)
<br/><input type="checkbox" name="blkads" checked/> Enable BLKads (reduces payouts by 75% if disabled)
<br/><input type="checkbox" name="xpmads"/> Enable XPMads (annoying audio, +10% to payouts)
